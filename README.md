# 📱 Mom's Shop Manager - Android App

Welcome to **Mom's Shop Manager**, an Android app built with Kotlin to help my mom manage her shop efficiently. This app helps her track inventory, record sales, generate daily reports, and more. It’s designed to simplify her daily operations and make her business life a little bit easier.

### 💡 About the Project

As my mom's shop grew, she found it increasingly difficult to manage everything manually. She needed a solution to keep track of stock, record sales, and get reports without diving into complicated spreadsheets. So, I decided to build this app for her using **Android Studio** with **Kotlin** to make sure it’s simple, functional, and easy to use.

### 🛠️ Features

* **Stock Management**: Add, update, and track items in the shop’s inventory.
* **Sales Recording**: Record each sale with details about items, quantity, and total amount.
* **Daily Reports**: Generate daily sales reports with a summary of transactions and stock updates.
* **More Features Coming Soon**: Future updates will include advanced features like:

  * Customer management 👥
  * Graphical sales analysis 📈
  * Automatic restock notifications 🔔

### 🌟 Current & Future Goals

* **Current Goal**: Provide an intuitive and smooth user experience to manage daily shop operations.
* **Future Features**: Future versions will include:

  * Visualized sales reports 📊
  * Customer database and contact management 🧑‍💼
  * Restock alerts when inventory is low 🔄

### 🧑‍💻 Tech Stack

* **Programming Language**: Kotlin
* **IDE**: Android Studio
* **Database**: Firebase / SQLite (depending on your choice)
* **Authentication**: Firebase Authentication (for user management, if applicable)
* **Other Tools**: Firebase Cloud Functions, Firestore (if using Firebase), Room Database (if using local storage)
